## Technologies

For this project, I used **Html** and **Css**.       
I used it to practice my **Bootstrap** and **Grid** Skills.
I wanted to try **Github Pages**, so I deployed it here.
               
               
                 
## Motivation

It was the first project writting html and css. And it helped me to practice because I changed the theme and added a couple of links.    
_I was following Udemy's Course [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WisAEITeFhSTXoJ/)._
